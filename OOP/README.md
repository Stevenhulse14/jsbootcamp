## 1. Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects”, which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. Common principles of OOP include:

# Encapsulation:

Bundling data (properties) and methods (functions) together inside objects.

# Abstraction:

Hiding internal details and showing only necessary features.

# Inheritance:

Creating new classes from existing classes, allowing code reusability.

# Polymorphism:

Providing a single interface to different data types or classes (for example, overriding methods).
