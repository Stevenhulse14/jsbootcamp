## 1. Asynchronicity in JavaScript

**Key Concepts**

- **Single-Threaded Nature**: JavaScript has one main thread that processes tasks sequentially.
- **Call Stack**: Where your currently executing functions live.
- **Event Loop**: Orchestrates when the call stack can process additional events from the callback queue.
- **Callback/Task Queue**: Holds functions ready to run once the call stack is clear.

**Why It Matters**

- Prevents blocking the UI or user interactions.
- Allows efficient handling of I/O, API calls, and other time-consuming operations.

---

## 2. Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

**Comparison Points**

- **Synchronous** (Blocking): Each operation must complete before the next starts.
  - Example: Looping through an array with CPU-intensive operations, preventing user interaction.
- **Asynchronous** (Non-Blocking): Tasks can be initiated, and you can continue other work while waiting for them to finish.
  - Example: Fetching data from an API while continuing to render a user interface.

**Real-World Examples**

- **Synchronous**: Reading a file from the local filesystem in a synchronous manner, halting code execution until the read is complete.
- **Asynchronous**: Making a network request and allowing the rest of the application to run while waiting for a response.

**Performance Implications**

- Asynchronous code generally leads to more responsive applications.
- Proper error handling and design patterns are crucial to avoid “callback hell.”

## 3. XMLHttpRequest (XHR)

Below is an expanded version of the curriculum section on **XMLHttpRequest (XHR)**. Feel free to merge this content into your existing curriculum. You can also adapt or reorganize as you see fit.

The **XMLHttpRequest** object (often called **XHR**) is a built-in browser API that allows you to send HTTP or HTTPS requests to web servers and handle their responses. It was one of the first ways JavaScript code could perform asynchronous operations to fetch data from servers without reloading the web page.

### 1. Creating an XHR Object

```js
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
```

**Key Points:**

- You can create multiple `XMLHttpRequest` objects to handle different requests.
- Each `XMLHttpRequest` instance manages exactly one network request at a time.

### 2. Opening a Connection

```js
xhr.open("GET", "https://api.example.com/data");
```

**Parameters of `xhr.open()`**:

1. **Method**: e.g., `'GET'`, `'POST'`, `'PUT'`, `'DELETE'`, etc.
2. **URL**: The endpoint or resource you want to access.
3. **Async Flag (Optional)**: `true` by default, which is almost always what you want for non-blocking requests.

**Key Points:**

- Calling `open()` sets the request method, URL, and whether the request runs asynchronously.
- You can also include optional user credentials (username/password) as additional parameters, though that’s less common nowadays.

### 3. Setting Request Headers

Before sending the request, you often need to set headers — for example, to indicate the content type or authorization:

```js
xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
xhr.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Bearer your_access_token");
```

**Common Headers:**

- `Content-Type`: Tells the server the format of the data being sent (e.g., `application/json`, `text/plain`).
- `Accept`: Tells the server the format you’d like to receive (e.g., `application/json`).
- `Authorization`: Used for passing credentials or tokens (e.g., a JWT).

### 4. Sending the Request

```js
xhr.send(JSON.stringify({ name: "New Item" }));
```

- **GET requests**: Often don’t include a body, so you’d call `xhr.send()` with no arguments.
- **POST/PUT/PATCH**: Typically send a JSON (or other format) payload.

### 5. Understanding the Request Life Cycle

`XMLHttpRequest` has an internal state machine that updates the `readyState` property as the request progresses:

| **ReadyState Value** | **Meaning**                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0 (UNSENT)           | The request is not yet initialized                      |
| 1 (OPENED)           | `open()` has been called                                |
| 2 (HEADERS_RECEIVED) | `send()` has been called; headers received              |
| 3 (LOADING)          | Downloading response; `responseText` holds partial data |
| 4 (DONE)             | The operation is complete                               |

You can listen to `readystatechange` events to track progress:

```js
xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
  if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
    if (xhr.status === 200) {
      console.log("Success:", xhr.responseText);
    } else {
      console.error("Error:", xhr.status);
    }
  }
};
```

> **Note**: Many developers prefer using `xhr.onload` and `xhr.onerror` because they trigger once the request is finished or fails, respectively, but `readystatechange` is more granular.

### 6. Handling Responses

When the `readyState` equals `4` (DONE), you can access the server’s response via:

- `xhr.responseText`: The raw text response (string).
- `xhr.responseType`: Allows you to set how the response is interpreted (e.g., `""` (default string), `"json"`, `"blob"`, `"document"`, etc.).
- `xhr.response`: The response body, automatically converted to the specified `responseType` if set.

```js
xhr.onload = function () {
  if (xhr.status === 200) {
    // Accessing responseText directly
    const data = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
    console.log("Data received:", data);
  } else {
    console.error("Request failed with status:", xhr.status);
  }
};
```

### 7. Error Handling

**Example using `onerror`:**

```js
xhr.onerror = function () {
  console.error("Network Error or CORS issue occurred");
};
```

Common scenarios:

- **Network Error**: If the request can’t reach the server at all (e.g., offline, DNS error).
- **CORS Error**: If the server doesn’t allow cross-origin requests from your domain.
- **Timeout**: If you set `xhr.timeout` and the request exceeds that time.

```js
xhr.timeout = 5000; // 5 seconds
xhr.ontimeout = function () {
  console.error("Request timed out!");
};
```

### 8. Working with Different Data Types

- **Text** (Default)  
  `xhr.responseType = ''; // or 'text'`
- **JSON**
  ```js
  xhr.responseType = "json";
  xhr.onload = function () {
    if (xhr.status === 200) {
      console.log(xhr.response); // Already a JS object
    }
  };
  ```
- **Blob** (Binary data)
  ```js
  xhr.responseType = "blob";
  ```
- **Document** (HTML/XML)
  ```js
  xhr.responseType = "document";
  ```

### 9. Handling Progress

You can track the download progress by listening for `progress` events:

```js
xhr.onprogress = function (event) {
  if (event.lengthComputable) {
    const percentComplete = (event.loaded / event.total) * 100;
    console.log(`Downloaded ${percentComplete}%`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Downloaded ${event.loaded} bytes`);
  }
};
```

### 10. Handling Cross-Domain Requests (CORS)

- Modern browsers enforce **Same-Origin Policy**.
- To allow cross-origin XHR calls, the server must set appropriate CORS headers (like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`).
- If the server does not allow your domain, the request will fail with a CORS error.

### 11. Putting It All Together: Example XHR Request

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>XHR Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button id="loadDataBtn">Load Data</button>

    <script>
      document.getElementById("loadDataBtn").addEventListener("click", () => {
        const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

        // Optional: track progress
        xhr.onprogress = function (event) {
          if (event.lengthComputable) {
            console.log(
              `Downloaded: ${((event.loaded / event.total) * 100).toFixed(2)}%`
            );
          }
        };

        // Handle the response
        xhr.onload = function () {
          if (xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300) {
            // Parse JSON data
            const responseData = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
            console.log("Data:", responseData);
          } else {
            console.error(`Error: Status code ${xhr.status}`);
          }
        };

        // Error handling
        xhr.onerror = function () {
          console.error("Network Error or CORS issue.");
        };

        // Open the request
        xhr.open("GET", "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");

        // Optionally set headers
        // xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');

        // Send the request
        xhr.send();
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**What this example does:**

1. Listens for a button click.
2. Creates an `XMLHttpRequest`.
3. Opens a `GET` request to a sample JSON API.
4. Logs progress, handles success, or logs errors.
5. Logs the JSON response to the console.

### Summary of Expanded XHR Concepts

- **Creating** and **opening** an `XMLHttpRequest` is straightforward but requires attention to method, URL, and async usage.
- **Headers** are crucial for proper communication, especially JSON-based.
- **`readyState`** changes can be tracked, but using event handlers like `onload` and `onerror` simplifies state management in most cases.
- **Error handling** includes listening to network errors, timeouts, and potential CORS issues.
- **Progress events** provide a way to track how much data has downloaded (or uploaded).
- **Cross-origin requests** might need special handling on the server side via CORS headers.

This more in-depth exploration of `XMLHttpRequest` should help you or your learners gain a solid understanding of how to implement and handle different situations with XHR. Once comfortable with XHR, many developers move on to the newer `fetch()` API and higher-level libraries (e.g., Axios), but understanding XHR’s fundamentals is excellent for a deeper knowledge of how things work under the hood.

## 4. JSON & AJAX CRUD Operations

**CRUD with AJAX**

- **Create (POST)**:
  ```js
  xhr.open("POST", "https://api.example.com/items");
  xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
  xhr.send(JSON.stringify({ name: "New Item" }));
  ```
- **Read (GET)**:
  ```js
  xhr.open("GET", "https://api.example.com/items");
  xhr.send();
  ```
- **Update (PUT or PATCH)**:
  ```js
  xhr.open("PUT", "https://api.example.com/items/123");
  xhr.send(JSON.stringify({ name: "Updated Name" }));
  ```
- **Delete (DELETE)**:
  ```js
  xhr.open("DELETE", "https://api.example.com/items/123");
  xhr.send();
  ```

**Working with JSON Data**

- Use `JSON.parse()` to convert JSON strings to JavaScript objects.
- Use `JSON.stringify()` to convert JavaScript objects to JSON strings.

**Error Handling and Status Codes**

- Common status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
- Handling server validation errors and timeouts

## 5. Asynchronous Patterns

**Callbacks**

- **Definition**: A function passed as an argument to another function.
- **Pros**: Simple for small tasks.
- **Cons**: Can lead to deeply nested code (“callback hell”).

**Promises**

- **Creating a Promise**:
  ```js
  const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // async logic
    if (success) resolve(data);
    else reject(error);
  });
  ```
- **Promise Chaining**:
  ```js
  myPromise
    .then((result) => {
      /* handle success */
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      /* handle error */
    });
  ```
- **Promise.all() / Promise.race()** for parallel or competing operations.

**Async/Await (Modern Approach)**

- **Syntax and Usage**:
  ```js
  async function fetchData() {
    try {
      const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
      const data = await response.json();
      console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  }
  ```
- **Advantages**: More readable, “synchronous-like” style.
- **Error Handling**: Use try/catch blocks around `await`.

---

## 6. Error Handling

In asynchronous code, errors can arise in different ways:

- Network or server failures (e.g., 404, 500).
- Application logic errors (e.g., JSON parsing failures).
- Timeout or connection lost.

**Best Practices**

1. Always use try/catch with async/await.
2. Leverage `.catch()` for Promises.
3. Consider using a global error handler or centralized logging.

---

## 7. Practical Tips and Best Practices

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Always have fallback UI or functionality if an async call fails.
2. **Canceling Requests**:
   - Using [AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) in modern browsers.
   - Handling manual request timeouts or user interactions to cancel a pending request.
3. **Debouncing/Throttling**:
   - Useful when triggering many async calls in quick succession (e.g., input events).
4. **Code Organization**:
   - Separate your API calls into dedicated modules/services.
   - Keep UI logic independent of direct XHR or fetch calls where possible.

---

## 8. Prerequisites

- **Core JavaScript**: Variables, data types, functions, objects.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Basic document querying and event handling.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the basic structure and style of the examples.
- **HTTP & REST**: Familiarity with request methods (GET, POST, etc.) and status codes.

### Final Thoughts

Asynchronous JavaScript can be challenging, especially for those new to the concepts of the event loop and non-blocking I/O. By following a structured approach—starting with callbacks, then moving on to Promises and async/await—learners will build a solid foundation and be able to tackle real-world tasks confidently.

Happy learning and coding!
